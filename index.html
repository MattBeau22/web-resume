        <p>
          Motivated 4th year Computer Science student with a love for UI and UX
          design. Coursework has helped me developed a strong understanding of
          algorithms, data structures, and programming languages such as Python
          and C and I’m currently exploring HTML and Javascript. I have applied
          my knowledge to completing a variety of projects, individually and in
          collaboration with team members, while honing problem-solving,
          time-management, organizational, and prioritization skills.
